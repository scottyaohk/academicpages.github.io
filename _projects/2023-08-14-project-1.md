An AI-powered IELTS speaking practicing app.

- I also prepared a short video introducing the basic features of this app.

<div>
<video id="video" controls="" width=100%>
  <source id="mp4" src="/images/projects/kaoyazhan/KYZ_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</videos>
</div>


- This is the first start-up experience I had. I am the co-founder of this project and I developed all the backend part. I also did some product manager work.
- Currently, we have encountered some problems with PMF (maybe promotion as well). If you are interested in this project, please contact me. I am happy to tell you more about our situation. My email is yaoxiangfd@gmail.com and my WeChat is 18817750258.
