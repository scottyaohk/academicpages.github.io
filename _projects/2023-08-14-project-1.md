If you are going to take an IELTS test and don't know how to prepare for the speaking part, this app can generate and polish your answers for all topics of IELTS speaking questions using AI technology. You can also accumulate all the generated answers in one place for further review.

- I also prepared a short video introducing the basic features of this app.

- This is the first start-up experience I had. I am the co-founder of this project and I developed all the backend part. I also did some product manager work.
