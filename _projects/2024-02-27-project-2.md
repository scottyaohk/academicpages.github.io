This is a blog about the development of my first drone. I had the idea of building a drone from scratch earlier this year and have been working on it part-time. I find it very enjoyable gradually approaching the goal using the knowledge and engineering skills I learnt.

Here is a step by step recording of my drone building process.

- Design and build the 3D model of the drone frame (consists of one body and four arms) using FreeCAD
  - <div><video id="video" controls="" width="100%"><source id="mp4" src="/images/projects/drone/3D建模.mp4" type="video/mp4"></videos></div>

- Print the frame using a 3D printer
  - <div><video id="video" controls="" width="100%"><source id="mp4" src="/images/projects/drone/3D打印.mp4" type="video/mp4"></videos></div>

- Draw the schematics and wire it on a PCB using KiCAD
  - <div><video id="video" controls="" width="100%"><source id="mp4" src="/images/projects/drone/PCB.mp4" type="video/mp4"></videos></div>

- Solder all electronic components onto the PCB
  - <div><video id="video" controls="" width="100%"><source id="mp4" src="/images/projects/drone/Soldering.mp4" type="video/mp4"></videos></div>

- Write the control algorithm and do the tuning (still in progress). Below are some failed tests.
  - <div><video id="video" controls="" width="100%"><source id="mp4" src="/images/projects/drone/tests.mp4" type="video/mp4"></videos></div>

I will continue to work on this project until achieving a drone with perfect balancing capabilities controlled in stabilization mode.
