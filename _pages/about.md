Hello, my name is YaoXiang :)

- I am interested in artificial intelligence and all those sci-fi like things. Currently, I devotes 80% of my time to deep learning and 20% in other fields. 
- I am currently looking for full-time research assistant positions. Here is what I have experience in:
  - Artificial Intelligence:
    - Implementing deep learning algorithms, including reinforcement learning, CV-related models, fintuning LLMs, GNN, etc.
    - I like to read famous AI papers, try to understand the thoughts behind them, figure out all the details and implement them myself.
  - Backend Development:
    - I've had the experience of designing and implementing the whole backend system myself.
    - I am familiar with Flask, Nginx, Redis, Docker, etc.
  - Hardware:
    - I am currently DIYing a drone at home. I designed the PCB board using KICAD and all 3D parts using FreeCAD. I am currently trying to put all these things together and tuning a working control algorithm. I will upload the video once finished.
    - I am also learning how to build a service robot with my friend.
- I had one full-time RA experience at HKU. My mentor is Prof. Lionel Li. I mainly helped with implementing deep learning algorithms to facilitate my mentor's research in applied machine learning.
- I had start up experience before. You can see it [here](https://scottyaohk.github.io/posts/2023/08/project-1/).
- I decided to learn more about technology after my last year in FDU. Before that, I did many internships in finance. I was an investment intern in Tencent and Eastern bell Capital and an investment banking intern at CITICS and Everbright Securities, where I learned a lot of business related stuff.
